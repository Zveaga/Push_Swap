# Push_Swap 
The goal of push_swap is to write a program that sorts numbers and displays them on the standard output.

## Return Value

## Key Concepts
- Linked lists
- Sorting algorithms
- 

## How To Use
Clone the repository:
```
git clone 
```
Move inside the directory:
```
cd 
```
Compile:
```
make
```
This will create an executable called ``.
